# 🤖 Customer Support Data Processing with n8n

This project contains a customer support data processing workflow built using n8n. It demonstrates how to retrieve customer information from a datastore, transform the data, and send personalized messages to customers.

## 🚀 Features

- **Manual Trigger**: Execute workflow on demand for testing and processing
- **Customer Data Retrieval**: Fetches customer records from n8n training datastore
- **Data Transformation**: Restructures customer data into standardized format
- **Personalized Messaging**: Generates and sends custom messages to customers
- **Scalable Processing**: Handles multiple customer records efficiently

## 🛠 Workflow Overview

The workflow consists of four main nodes:

1. **Manual Trigger** – Initiates the workflow execution
2. **Customer Datastore** – Retrieves customer records (limited to 10)
3. **Edit Fields** – Transforms and standardizes customer data
4. **Customer Messenger** – Sends personalized messages to customers

## 💬 Data Processing in Action

The workflow processes customer data by:
1. Retrieving customer records with name, email, notes, and country
2. Transforming data into standardized fields (customer_name, customer_email, customer_query, customer_address)
3. Generating personalized messages for each customer
4. Sending messages through the customer messenger system

## 🔍 Use Cases

- **Customer Onboarding**: Welcome new customers with personalized messages
- **Support Follow-ups**: Send automated responses to customer queries
- **Data Standardization**: Normalize customer data from various sources
- **Bulk Messaging**: Process multiple customer records simultaneously

## 📊 Data Flow

1. **Input**: Customer records from datastore
2. **Processing**: Data transformation and field mapping
3. **Output**: Personalized customer messages
4. **Delivery**: Automated message sending via messenger system
